# Cuby V1 
 
 I was planning on doing my own version of the "Useless Box concept" , so i decided to create cuby. I started it in January 2020 and i finished the first version. But i'm planning on making a V2 with more stuff and a real tutoriel to allow anyone to make his own ;)
 
 There is around 20 animation currently , feel free to commit your own ;)
